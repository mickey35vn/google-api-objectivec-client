Google APIs Client Library for Objective-C
Written by Google, this library is a flexible and efficient Objective-C framework for accessing JSON APIs.

This is the recommended library for accessing JSON-based Google APIs for iOS and Mac OS X applications. The library is compatible with applications built for iOS 3 and later, and Mac OS X 10.5 and later.

To get started with Google APIs and the Objective-C client library, read the introduction and study the example applications.
